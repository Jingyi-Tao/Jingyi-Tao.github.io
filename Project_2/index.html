                    <h2>Reid Glacier/Flying Butterss/Wy’ East</h2>

                    <p class="subtitle"><em>BY NICK MASLEN | MARCH 15, 2021</em></p>

                    <p class="main-text">This trip report is intended to inform climbers of the current conditions on the lesser frequented aspects of the mountain, piggybacking off of the 3/1/21 PMR presentation that highlighted other routes on Mt. Hood beyond the standard route. There is a lot of route information already about the standard route as of 3/15/21, so the trip/conditions will be focused on the other aspects we climbed/skied.<br>
                    <br>
                    We set out to do a multi route trip up Mt. Hood on Saturday, 3/13/21. Our route of travel was from Timberline up the Reid Glacier Headwall to the top of the West Crater Rim, ski down to Devil’s Kitchen, climb up the Flying Buttress route to the East Crater Rim, then ski down the Wy’East face/White River Canyon back to Timberline. This allowed us to see 2 aspects of the mountain while skiing and avoid the crowds on an inherently busy weekend.</p>

                    <h2>Ice Climbing in Washington with Mountain Bureau LLC</h2>

                    <p class="subtitle"><em>BY THERESA SILVEYRA | FEBRUARY 14, 2021</em></p>

                    <p class="main-text">After cancelling my ice climbing trip to Bozeman, Montana twice due to COVID, I was starting to feel kind of hopeless about getting a chance to improve in the sport following a less than ideal introduction earlier in 2020. Then, in early December, I saw an Instagram post by Mountain Bureau about ice climbing courses they would be offering in Washington state! I immediately reached out with a request to be notified when conditions were suitable enough to book a course. Although those ideal conditions didn’t happen right away, I finally received that long awaited email the first week in February and booked a two-day course for the following weekend. <br>
                    <br>
                    The day before we left, we woke up to snow in Portland. Although we’d been following the forecast, I’d kept my fingers crossed that maybe it would be on the lesser side. Still set on going, we stopped by Mountain Shop to rent gear for our trip: a pair of Petzl Nomics and Cassin X-All Mountain tools, as well as some Grivel G14 crampons.</p>

                    <h2>Pahto (Mt Adams) Circumnav Trip Report</h2>

                    <p class="subtitle"><em>BY MOUNTAIN SHOP | AUGUST 18, 2020</em></p>

                    <p class="main-text">It seems like most people in Portland have found or rekindled their love for the outdoors, and are spending more time outside recreating than ever. This has made summer at the shop a busy one. I, perversely, have spent quite a bit less time outdoors than previous summers. A combination of injuries, cancelled races, busy work schedule, house hunting in a crazy market and a host of other excuses have kept me inside a lot more than I prefer. I’ve really only been inspired by exploring new to me terrain close to home, which has meant some long bike rides in the darker corners of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. While working this last week, another idea piqued my interest: an overnight backpacking trip circumnavigating Pahto (Mt. Adams).</p>
